# Features:

The application lets the user track their risk of being infected, built on the information they provide. It also gives the ability to track symptoms and compare it to the ones from previous days, which are saved, for the maximum safety level, in the phone storage.\
The app also displays a map with marked sanitary-epidemiological stations and the user's location.\
The last feature faces the needs of people during their quarantine time. The app allows the user to enter the date they are going to end their quarantine to track how many days left and to show them daily tips about various activities, health and self-improvement in their spare time to while away the hours and make it easier for them to go through the isolation time.
