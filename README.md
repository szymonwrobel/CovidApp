# Features:

The application lets the user track their risk of being infected, built on the information they provide. It also gives the ability to track symptoms and compare it to the ones from previous days, which are saved, for the maximum safety level, in the phone storage.
The app also displays a map with marked sanitary-epidemiological station and the user's location.
